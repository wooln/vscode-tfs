## Important !

> **You MUST have a Visual Studio with Team Foundation Server features to be able to use this extension.**

> **I used TFS because my last company did but I don't use it anymore. So I, and most of this extension users, would be really happy to find some people able to contribute to this extension (and its [tfs](https://github.com/ivangabriele/tfs) dependency) :star:**<br>
> Contact me if you're willing to help at ivan.gabriele@gmail.com :mailbox:

## Installation

1. Open up VS Code
2. Type **`F1`**
3. Type `ext` in command palette.

5. Type `tfs`
6. Select **`TFS`** extension and hit **`ENTER`**

## Issues

Please report any issue or comment [here](https://github.com/ivangabriele/vscode-tfs/issues).

## Contribute

To be able to contribute to TFS development, you need to be at ease with **NodeJS** language and **Git** usage.
